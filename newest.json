        "description": "From the award-winning author of Our Wives Under the Sea, a speculative reimagining of King Lear, centering three sisters navigating queer love and loss in a drowning world It\u2019s been raining for a long time now, so long that the land has reshaped itself and arcane rituals and religions are creeping back into practice. Sisters Isla, Irene, and Agnes have not spoken in some time when their father dies. An architect as cruel as he was revered, his death offers an opportunity for the sisters to come together in a new way. In the grand glass house they grew up in, their father\u2019s most famous creation, the sisters sort through the secrets and memories he left behind, until their fragile bond is shattered by a revelation in his will. More estranged than ever, the sisters\u2019 lives spin out of control: Irene\u2019s relationship is straining at the seams; Isla\u2019s ex-wife keeps calling; and cynical Agnes is falling in love for the first time. But something even more sinister might be unfolding, something related to their mother\u2019s long-ago disappearance and the strangers who have always seemed unusually interested in the sisters\u2019 lives. Soon, it becomes clear that the sisters have been chosen for a very particular purpose, one with shattering implications for their family and their imperiled world.",

        "description": "In her debut collection of short fiction, Amanda Peters describes the Indigenous experience from an astonishingly wide spectrum in time and place\u2014from contact with the first European settlers, to the forced removal of Indigenous children, to the present-day fight for the right to clean water. These intimate stories meld traditional storytelling with beautiful, spare prose that portray the dignity of the traditional way of life, the humiliations of systemic racism, and the resilient power to endure. A young man returns from residential school only to realize he can no longer communicate with his own parents. A young woman finds purpose and healing on the front lines as a water protector. An old man remembers his life as he patiently waits for death. And a young girl nervously dances in her first Mawi\u2019omi. The collection also includes the Indigenous Voices Award\u2013nominated story \u201cPejipug (Winter Arrives)\" as well the Indigenous Voices Award-winning title story. At times sad, sometimes disturbing, but always redemptive, the stories in Waiting for the Long Night Moon will remind you that where there is grief there is also joy, where there is trauma there is resilience and, most importantly, there is power.",

Online, AARP, BookBub, BookRiot \u201cFor anyone who\u2019s ever craved a seat at the Round Table. Utterly enchanting.\u201d \u2014Rebecca Yarros, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Fourth Wing and Iron Flame \u201cIf you love King Arthur as much as I do, you\u2019ll love Lev Grossman\u2019s The Bright Sword, a fresh and engrossing take on the Matter of Britain featuring a colorful cast of Round Table knights who don\u2019t often get as much story time as they deserve. The creator of The Magicians has woven another spell.\u201d \u2014George R. R. Martin, #1 New York Times bestselling author of A Game of Thrones The #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Magicians trilogy returns with a triumphant reimagining of the King Arthur legend for the new millennium A gifted young knight named Collum arrives at Camelot to compete for a spot on the Round Table, only to find that he\u2019s too late. The king died two weeks ago at the Battle of Camlann, leaving no heir, and only a handful of the knights of the Round Table survive. They aren\u2019t the heroes of legend, like Lancelot or Gawain. They\u2019re the oddballs of the Round Table, from the edges of the stories, like Sir Palomides, the Saracen Knight, and Sir Dagonet, Arthur\u2019s fool, who was knighted as a joke. They\u2019re joined by Nimue, who was Merlin\u2019s apprentice until she turned on him and buried him under a hill. Together this ragtag fellowship will set out to rebuild Camelot in a world that has lost its balance. But Arthur\u2019s death has revealed Britain\u2019s fault lines. God has abandoned it, and the fairies and monsters and old gods are returning, led by Arthur\u2019s half-sister Morgan le Fay. Kingdoms are turning on each other, warlords lay siege to Camelot and rival factions are forming around the disgraced Lancelot and the fallen Queen Guinevere. It is up to Collum and his companions to reclaim Excalibur, solve the mysteries of this ruined world and make it whole again. But before they can restore Camelot they\u2019ll have to learn the truth of why the lonely, brilliant King Arthur fell, and lay to rest the ghosts of his troubled family and of Britain\u2019s dark past. The first major Arthurian epic of the new millennium, The Bright Sword is steeped in tradition, full of duels and quests, battles and tournaments, magic swords and Fisher Kings. It also sheds a fresh light on Arthur\u2019s Britain, a diverse, complex nation struggling to come to terms with its bloody history. The Bright Sword is a story about imperfect men and women, full of strength and pain, who are looking for a way to reforge a broken land in spite of being broken themselves.",

        "description": "Chief of Police Kate Burkholder investigates a gruesome murder that reveals a little-known chapter of early Amish history in this next riveting installment of the bestselling series by Linda Castillo. Newlywed Chief of Police Kate Burkholder is awakened by an urgent midnight call summoning her to a suspicious fire in the woods. When she arrives at the scene, she discovers a charred body. According to the coroner, the deceased, an Amish man named Milan Swanz, was chained to a stake and burned alive. It is an appalling and eerily symbolic crime against an upstanding husband and father. Kate knows all too well that the Amish prefer to handle their problems without interference from the outside world, and no one will speak about the murdered man. From what she\u2019s able to piece together, Swanz led a deeply troubled life and had recently been excommunicated. But if that\u2019s the case, why are the Amish so reluctant to talk about him? Are they protecting the memory of one of their own? Or are they afraid of something they dare not share? When her own brother is implicated in the case, Kate finds herself not only at odds with the Amish, the world of which she was once a part, but also the English community and her counterparts in law enforcement. The investigation takes a violent turn when Kate\u2019s life is threatened by a mysterious stranger. To uncover the truth about the death of Milan Swanz, Kate must dive deep into the Anabaptist culture, peering into all the dark corners of its history, only to uncover a secret legacy that shatters everything she thought she knew about the Amish themselves\u2014and her own roots.",

        "description": "An exhilarating novel about one American family, the dark moment that shatters their suburban paradise, and the wild legacy of trauma and inheritance, from the New York Times bestselling author of Fleishman Is in Trouble \u201cA big, juicy, wickedly funny social satire . . . probably the funniest book ever about generational family trauma.\u201d\u2014Oprah Daily \u201cWere we gangsters? No. But did we know how to start a fire?\u201d In 1980, a wealthy businessman named Carl Fletcher is kidnapped from his driveway, brutalized, and held for ransom. He is returned to his wife and kids less than a week later, only slightly the worse, and the family moves on with their lives, resuming their prized places in the saga of the American dream, comforted in the realization that though their money may have been what endangered them, it is also what assured them their safety. But now, nearly forty years later, it\u2019s clear that perhaps nobody ever got over anything, after all. Carl has spent the ensuing years secretly seeking closure to the matter of his kidnapping, while his wife, Ruth, has spent her potential protecting her husband\u2019s emotional health. Their three grown children aren\u2019t doing much better: Nathan\u2019s chronic fear won\u2019t allow him to advance at his law firm; Beamer, a Hollywood screenwriter, will consume anything\u2014substance, foodstuff, women\u2014in order to numb his own perpetual terror; and Jenny has spent her life so bent on proving that she\u2019s not a product of her family\u2019s pathology that she has come to define it. As they hover at the delicate precipice of a different kind of survival, they learn that the family fortune has dwindled to just about nothing, and they must face desperate questions about how much their wealth has played a part in both their lives\u2019 successes and failures. Long Island Compromise spans the entirety of one family\u2019s history, winding through decades and generations, all the way to the outrageous present, and confronting the mainstays of American Jewish life: tradition, the pursuit of success, the terror of history, fear of the future, old wives\u2019 tales, evil eyes, ambition, achievement, boredom, dybbuks, inheritance, pyramid schemes, right-wing capitalists, beta-blockers, psychics, and the mostly unspoken love and shared experience that unite a family forever.",

        "description": "\u201cSally Franson is a world class entertainer. She can finesse a serio-comic moment in a way that leaves you catching your breath. Deft and delicious, this book is a flat out delight machine. A heart opener, a page turner, and a true \u2018originell!' I laughed out loud, I ugly cried, and I never, ever wanted it to end.\" -- Meg Ryan, actor, writer, director A charming, wise, and laugh-out-loud funny novel following an American woman competing on a Swedish reality show in an attempt to discover her roots. Paulie Johansson has never put much stock in the idea of family: she has her long-term boyfriend Declan and beloved best friend Jemma, and that\u2019s more than enough for her. Yet one night on a lark, she lets Jemma convince her to audition for Sverige och Mig, a show on Swedish television where Swedish-Americans compete to win the ultimate prize: a reunion with their Swedish relatives. Much to her shock, her drunken submission video wins her a spot on the show, and against Declan\u2019s advice Paulie decides to go for it. Armed with her Polaroid camera, a beat-up copy of Pippi Longstocking, and an unquenchable sense of possibility, Paulie hops on a plane to Sweden and launches into the contest with seven other Americans, all under the watchful eye of a camera crew. At first, Paulie is certain that she and her competitors have nothing in common besides their passports and views their bloodthirsty ambitions with suspicion. Yet amid the increasingly absurd challenges\u2014rowing from Denmark to Sweden in the freezing rain, battling through obstacle courses, competing in a pickled herring eating contest\u2014Paulie finds herself rethinking her snap judgments about her fellow countrymen, while her growing attachment to her Swedish roots increases her resolve to win the competition herself. Grappling with long-held notions of family, friendship, and love\u2014not to mention her feelings for the distractingly handsome Swedish cameraman who\u2019s been assigned to follow her around\u2014Paulie starts to reconsider her past and rethink what she wants for the future. A fish-out-of-water tale filled with warmth, optimism, and wit, Big in Sweden is at its heart a love story: love for family, friends, country, and\u2014most importantly\u2014oneself. \"If you devoured Pippi Longstocking as a kid, you will not be able to turn away from Big in Sweden. Reading this hilarious, heartfelt book was even more fun than watching reality television. I absolutely loved it!\" \u2014 Jessica Anya Blau, author of Mary Jane",

        "description": "Sometimes you\u2019re so busy writing other people\u2019s stories that you lose the plot of your own. This wasn\u2019t how Kelsey Worthington\u2019s day was supposed to go. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be picking up Starbucks for her smarmy boss. She wasn\u2019t supposed to get hit by a car that jumped the curb. And she certainly wasn\u2019t supposed to wake up in a hospital room next to Georgina Tate\u2014the legendary matriarch of New York City businesswomen. Kelsey and Georgina couldn\u2019t be more opposite. Kelsey\u2019s a dreamer, a writer who questions her own skill. And Georgina is a confident businesswoman whose years of shouldering her way into boardrooms and making her voice heard have made her far too outspoken for the faint of heart. But now, when Georgina\u2019s failing kidneys force her to face some big regrets about the way she\u2019s lived her life, the two women recognize they share a common thread. Maybe it\u2019s time to confront a few things. They must ask themselves: What if I said yes to everything I\u2019ve always said no to? With Georgina as her companion, Kelsey soon finds herself doing things she\u2019s never done before. Eating street food. Swimming in the ocean. Matchmaking for Georgina with the help of Georgina\u2019s handsome son. And writing her own romance\u2014both in book form and in real life. So begins the Summer of Yes. Stand-alone novel Perfect for fans of Denise Hunter and Rachel Linden Book length: 100,000 words Includes discussion questions for book clubs",
