    "synopsis": "From the New York Times bestselling author of the Expanse comes a spectacular new space opera that sees humanity fighting for its survival in a war as old as the universe itself. ★ “Masterful . . . . This is space opera at its best.” – Publishers Weekly (starred review) \"The start of something truly epic.\"  ― Fonda Lee, author of Jade City How humanity came to the planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end. The Carryx – part empire, part hive – have waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy.  Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin.   Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team.  Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure.  Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to survive: learning to understand – and manipulate – the Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination.  He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins. \"Corey is always one of the most engaging voices in the genre.\"  ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of Children of Time \"A bang up read. I want more.\"  ― Paolo Bacigalupi, author of The Water Knife \"A powerful, provocative masterpiece that I will be thinking about for a very long time.\"  ― Ryka Aoki, author of Light from Uncommon Stars",

    "synopsis": "In the vein of Where’d You Go, Bernadette and Fleishman Is in Trouble, a wickedly funny and incisive debut novel following a mother trapped in the rat race of NYC parenting as her life unravels. \"Funny, relatable fiction for anyone who thinks they're above the fray but still want to read all about it.\"—People \"Heavenly hilarity for readers.\"—Good Housekeeping It takes a village...just not this one.  Annie Lewin is at the end of her rope. She’s a mother of three young children, her workaholic husband is never around, and the vicious competition for spots in New York City’s kindergartens is heating up. A New York Times journalist-turned-parenting-advice-columnist for an internet start-up, Annie can’t help but judge the insanity of it all—even as she finds herself going to impossible lengths to secure the best spot for her own son. As Annie comes to terms with the infinitesimal odds of success, her intensifying rivalry with hotshot lawyer Belinda Brenner—a deliciously hateful nemesis, what with her perfectly curated bento box lunches and effortless Instagram chic—pushes her to the brink. Of course, this newly raw and unhinged version of Annie is great for the advice column: the more she spins out, the more clicks and comments she gets. But when she commits a ghastly social faux pas that goes viral, she’s forced to confront the question: is she really any better than the cutthroat parents she always judged? A shimmering epistolary novel incorporating emails, group texts, advice columns, newspaper profiles, and more, Plays Well with Others is a whip-smart, genuinely funny romp through the minefield of modern motherhood. But beneath its fast-paced, satirical veneer, Brickman gives us a fresh, open-hearted, all-too-real take on what it means to be a parent—fierce love, craziness, and all.  ",

Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia, this wild and wondrous novel is a fairy tale for grown-ups who still knock on the back of wardrobes—just in case—from the author of The Wishing Game. “This is the book you’ve been waiting for.”—Richard Russo, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Empire Falls and the North Bath Trilogy As boys, best friends Jeremy Cox and Rafe Howell went missing in a vast West Virginia state forest, only to mysteriously reappear six months later with no explanation for where they’d gone or how they’d survived. Fifteen years after their miraculous homecoming, Rafe is a reclusive artist who still bears scars inside and out but has no memory of what happened during those months. Meanwhile, Jeremy has become a famed missing persons’ investigator. With his uncanny abilities, he is the one person who can help vet tech Emilie Wendell find her sister, who vanished in the very same forest as Rafe and Jeremy. Jeremy alone knows the fantastical truth about the disappearances, for while the rest of the world was searching for them, the two missing boys were in a magical realm filled with impossible beauty and terrible danger. He believes it is there that they will find Emilie’s sister. However, Jeremy has kept Rafe in the dark since their return for his own inscrutable reasons. But the time for burying secrets comes to an end as the quest for Emilie’s sister begins. The former lost boys must confront their shared past, no matter how traumatic the memories. Alongside the headstrong Emilie, Rafe and Jeremy must return to the enchanted world they called home for six months—for only then can they get back everything and everyone they’ve lost.",

No. But did we know how to start a fire?” In 1980, a wealthy businessman named Carl Fletcher is kidnapped from his driveway, brutalized, and held for ransom. He is returned to his wife and kids less than a week later, only slightly the worse, and the family moves on with their lives, resuming their prized places in the saga of the American dream, comforted in the realization that though their money may have been what endangered them, it is also what assured them their safety. But now, nearly forty years later, it’s clear that perhaps nobody ever got over anything, after all. Carl has spent the ensuing years secretly seeking closure to the matter of his kidnapping, while his wife, Ruth, has spent her potential protecting her husband’s emotional health. Their three grown children aren’t doing much better: Nathan’s chronic fear won’t allow him to advance at his law firm; Beamer, a Hollywood screenwriter, will consume anything—substance, foodstuff, women—in order to numb his own perpetual terror; and Jenny has spent her life so bent on proving that she’s not a product of her family’s pathology that she has come to define it. As they hover at the delicate precipice of a different kind of survival, they learn that the family fortune has dwindled to just about nothing, and they must face desperate questions about how much their wealth has played a part in both their lives’ successes and failures. Long Island Compromise spans the entirety of one family’s history, winding through decades and generations, all the way to the outrageous present, and confronting the mainstays of American Jewish life: tradition, the pursuit of success, the terror of history, fear of the future, old wives’ tales, evil eyes, ambition, achievement, boredom, dybbuks, inheritance, pyramid schemes, right-wing capitalists, beta-blockers, psychics, and the mostly unspoken love and shared experience that unite a family forever.",

She wasn’t supposed to be picking up Starbucks for her smarmy boss. She wasn’t supposed to get hit by a car that jumped the curb. And she certainly wasn’t supposed to wake up in a hospital room next to Georgina Tate—the legendary matriarch of New York City businesswomen. Kelsey and Georgina couldn’t be more opposite. Kelsey’s a dreamer, a writer who questions her own skill. And Georgina is a confident businesswoman whose years of shouldering her way into boardrooms and making her voice heard have made her far too outspoken for the faint of heart. But now, when Georgina’s failing kidneys force her to face some big regrets about the way she’s lived her life, the two women recognize they share a common thread. Maybe it’s time to confront a few things. They must ask themselves: What if I said yes to everything I’ve always said no to? With Georgina as her companion, Kelsey soon finds herself doing things she’s never done before. Eating street food. Swimming in the ocean. Matchmaking for Georgina with the help of Georgina’s handsome son. And writing her own romance—both in book form and in real life. So begins the Summer of Yes.

    "synopsis": "<p>Giovanna J. Giò è una donna di straordinaria bellezza e micidiale crudeltà. Ritiene di essere affetta da Sindrome Premestruale Perenne di Tipo 1, patologia che la porta a disprezzare chiunque.Se infatti le donne di Tipo 3, per via degli estrogeni, sono ben disposte nei confronti del genere umano e degli uomini in particolare, e le donne di Tipo 2 tengono a bada il disordine ormonale con shopping compulsivo e pinte di prosecco, le donne di Tipo 1 – ceppo al quale appartiene Giovanna – non hanno sbalzi di umore, perché sono sempre di pessimo umore. La loro è, per l'appunto, una sindrome premestruale perenne.A intervalli regolari, Giovanna scrive lettere infuocate all'Inps perché questa \"malattia\" venga riconosciuta come invalidante: in tal modo lei potrebbe ricevere un assegno mensile, trascorrere il tempo leggendo i capolavori incompresi della letteratura americana e lasciare il suo posto di dottoranda mal pagata in un'università romana.Giovanna ha infatti due nemici giurati: il mondo intero e il professor Enrico Mazzetti.A 74 anni suonati, Mazzetti non vuole mollare la cattedra malgrado non sappia distinguere Bukowski da John Fante, per il quale lei nutre un amore incondizionato e a cui racconta dentro di sé i propri piani di distruzione e di rinascita. E mentre il direttore dell'Inps riesce pian piano a scorgere una certa validità nelle folli istanze di invalidità di Giovanna, lei trova un'inquietante alleata di Tipo 1 in grado forse di portare Mazzetti al pensionamento. Graffiante, ironico, caustico: un romanzo trascinante e divertentissimo che mette a nudo, spingendoli al paradosso, i mali del nostro tempo, dalla questione di genere al precariato, dai rapporti di coppia alla salute del pianeta. Al suo esordio Roberta Casasole ci regala l'epopea selvaggia di una donna scatenata che non ha paura di nessuno e fa a pezzi ogni tabù. \"E poi ci siamo noi, le donne di Tipo 1, con Sindrome Premestruale Perenne. L'amore ci sussurra all'orecchio dolci parole e noi gli gridiamo che non c'è campo. Donne che non hanno sbalzi di umore, perché sono sempre di pessimo umore. Noi siamo le elette.\"Un romanzo irriverente e scatenato, oltre ogni tabù.Si ride da pagina 1 a pagina 293.<br></p>",

    "synopsis": "From the author of the Read with Jenna Bonus Pick A Little Hope, an uplifting and emotionally resonant novel set in a Delaware beach town about a local restaurant owner at a turning point. Three generations of Schmidts have run their family’s beachfront restaurant and Jack has been at the helm since the death of his father. Jack puts the demands of the restaurant above all else, with a string of failed relationships, no hobbies, and no days off as proof of his commitment to the place. He can’t remember the last time he sat on the beach, or even enjoyed a moment to himself. Meanwhile, the DelDine group has been gradually snapping up beloved eateries along this stretch of coast and are pursuing Jack with a very generous offer to take Schmidt’s off his hands. Jack craves companionship and maybe even a family. He wonders if closing the door on the restaurant might open a new window for him. But who would he be without Schmidt’s, and can he trust DelDine’s claims that they will continue to employ his staff and honor his family’s legacy? When he receives startling news from the past, Jack begins to reshape his life and forge unexpected new friendships. But will he really let go of the very things that have defined him?",

    "synopsis": "A novel of family, secrets, ghosts, and homecoming set on the seaside cliffs of Maine, by the New York Times best-selling author of Friends and Strangers<br/><br/>“A stunning achievement, and J. Courtney Sullivan’s best book yet. Sullivan weaves a narrative that’s fascinating and thought-provoking. I literally could not put this book down.”<br/>—Ann Napolitano, New York Times best-selling author of Hello Beautiful<br/><br/>On a secluded bluff overlooking the ocean sits a Victorian house, lavender with gingerbread trim, a home that contains a century’s worth of secrets. By the time Jane Flanagan discovers the house as a teenager, it has long been abandoned. The place is an irresistible mystery to Jane. There are still clothes in the closets, marbles rolling across the floors, and dishes in the cupboards, even though no one has set foot there in decades. The house becomes a hideaway for Jane, a place to escape her volatile mother.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, now a Harvard archivist, she returns home to Maine following a terrible mistake that threatens both her career and her marriage. Jane is horrified to find the Victorian is now barely recognizable. The new owner, Genevieve, a summer person from Beacon Hill, has gutted it, transforming the house into a glossy white monstrosity straight out of a shelter magazine. Strangely, Genevieve is convinced that the house is haunted—perhaps the product of something troubling Genevieve herself has done. She hires Jane to research the history of the place and the women who lived there. The story Jane uncovers—of lovers lost at sea, romantic longing, shattering loss, artistic awakening, historical artifacts stolen and sold, and the long shadow of colonialism—is even older than Maine itself.<br/><br/>Enthralling, richly imagined, filled with psychic mediums and charlatans, spirits and past lives, mothers, marriage, and the legacy of alcoholism, this is a deeply moving novel about the land we inhabit, the women who came before us, and the ways in which none of us will ever truly leave this earth.",

    "synopsis": "From the nationally bestselling author of the “powerful, heartbreaking” (Shelf Awareness) The Stationery Shop, a heartfelt, epic new novel of friendship, betrayal, and redemption set against three transformative decades in Tehran, Iran. In 1950s Tehran, seven-year-old Ellie lives in grand comfort until the untimely death of her father, forcing Ellie and her mother to move to a tiny home downtown. Lonely and bearing the brunt of her mother’s endless grievances, Ellie dreams of a friend to alleviate her isolation. Luckily, on the first day of school, she meets Homa, a kind, passionate girl with a brave and irrepressible spirit. Together, the two girls play games, learn to cook in the stone kitchen of Homa’s warm home, wander through the colorful stalls of the Grand Bazaar, and share their ambitions for becoming “lion women.” But their happiness is disrupted when Ellie and her mother are afforded the opportunity to return to their previous bourgeois life. Now a popular student at the best girls’ high school in Iran, Ellie’s memories of Homa begin to fade. Years later, however, her sudden reappearance in Ellie’s privileged world alters the course of both of their lives. Together, the two young women come of age and pursue their own goals for meaningful futures. But as the political turmoil in Iran builds to a breaking point, one earth-shattering betrayal will have enormous consequences. Written with Marjan Kamali’s signature “evocative, devastating, and hauntingly beautiful” (Whitney Scharer, author of The Age of Light) prose, The Lion Women of Tehran is a sweeping exploration of how profoundly we are shaped by those we meet when we are young, and the way love and courage transforms our lives.",

    "synopsis": "<p>- Scoprire la profondità della tristezza di un figlio, a neanche sedici anni, è come trovare qualcosa in un posto in cui non te lo saresti mai aspettato. In cui proprio non dovrebbe esserci.<br> - Che vuoi dire?<br> - Tipo, non so. Come trovare la neve in fondo al mare.Matteo Bussola racconta un nodo del nostro tempo: la fragilità adolescenziale. Scrive una storia toccante, piena di grazia, sul tradimento che implica diventare sé stessi. E ci mostra, con onestà e delicatezza, quel che si prova davanti al dolore di un figlio, ma anche la luce dell'essere genitori, che pure nel buio continua a brillare. Perché è difficile accogliere la verità di chi amiamo, soprattutto se lo abbiamo messo al mondo. Ma l'amore porta sempre con sé una rinascita. Un padre e un figlio, dentro una stanza. L'uno di fronte all'altro, come mai sono stati. Ciascuno lo specchio dell'altro. Loro due, insieme, in un reparto di neuropsichiatria infantile. Ci sono altri genitori, in quel reparto, altri figli. Adolescenti che rifiutano il cibo o che si fanno del male, che vivono l'estenuante fatica di crescere, dentro famiglie incapaci di dare un nome al loro tormento. E madri e padri spaesati, che condividono la stessa ferita, l'intollerabile sensazione di non essere piú all'altezza del proprio compito. Con la voce calda, intima, di un padre smarrito, Matteo Bussola fotografa l'istante spaventoso in cui genitori e figli smettono di riconoscersi, e parlarsi diventa impossibile. Attraverso un pugno di personaggi strazianti e bellissimi, ci ricorda che ogni essere umano è un mistero, anche quando siamo noi ad averlo generato.<br></p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>Salento, 1959. Lorenzo e Agnese hanno perso tutto. E lo capiscono quando, con gli occhi tristi che si porta dietro da una vita, il padre annuncia di aver venduto il saponificio di famiglia, un'eredità che lui ha vissuto come una condanna. Per Lorenzo e Agnese, invece, quella fabbrica che il nonno ha creato dal nulla, che profuma di talco, di essenze floreali e di oli vegetali, e che occupa ogni loro pensiero, era la certezza di un presente sereno e la promessa di un futuro da tracciare insieme, uniti. Quindi l'idea di rimanere lì come semplici operai sotto un nuovo, arrogante padrone è devastante per entrambi. Lorenzo, orgoglioso e impulsivo, se ne va sbattendo la porta, col cuore colmo di rabbia e con un solo obiettivo: trovare i soldi necessari per riprendersi quello che è suo. Ma Agnese non lo segue: tanto risoluta se si tratta di formulare saponi quanto insicura quando le tocca abitare il mondo al di fuori del saponificio, dichiara: «Io resto dov'è casa mia». È una crepa profonda, apparentemente insanabile, quella che si apre tra fratello e sorella e li spingerà su strade opposte e imprevedibili. Perché vogliono la stessa cosa, Lorenzo e Agnese, almeno finché l'amore non li porterà di nuovo a un bivio. Ognuno dei due farà una scelta, tracciando un altro domani… Sarà per entrambi un domani senza rimpianti? Questa è la storia della passione che prima unisce e poi divide un fratello e una sorella. Una storia che parla di decisioni prese ascoltando la mente o il cuore oppure tutti e due. Di quell'istante che può cambiare una vita intera. Ma anche di un'Italia che, incredula, sta scoprendo un improvviso benessere, che lavora alla catena di montaggio e poi canta con Mina e balla al ritmo del twist, giovane, creativa, impaziente…<br></p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>A Finalist for the 2024 Orwell Prize for Political Fiction </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A biting portrait of British class, politics, and money told through five interconnected families and their rising—and declining—fortunes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campbell Flynn, art historian, professor, and fêted fixture of the literati, always knew that when his life came crashing down, it would happen in public—yet he never imagined that a single year in London would expose so much. He’s never taken other people half as seriously as they take themselves, which is the first of his mistakes. The second is a new project: opportunistic and precisely calibrated to rake in a fortune. Riding on the high of a best-selling biography of Vermeer and fielding more inquiries and requests than he has the time or patience to pursue, Campbell has nevertheless still not managed to shake the question of money. The fact of his quiet loan from a school friend now embroiled in scandal makes the ever-present worry feel even more pressing. His unflappable agent, Atticus; his steadfast wife, Elizabeth; his sister, Moira, crusading parliamentarian for the poor; his well-adjusted, well-off adult children, Angus and Kenzie; and all the outward trappings of success can’t conceal that something in his life is off. As Campbell becomes increasingly entangled with a brilliant student, convention-smashing and working class, like he used to be, he feels he’s been given a second chance to embrace the change that frightens him, even as he sees trouble brewing for his family and friends. Campbell’s personal quest takes him down darker roads than he could have imagined, and all his worlds—the art scene and academia, fashion and the English aristocracy, journalism and the internet—collide in spectacular fashion, culminating in one shocking night on Caledonian Road.</p>",

Don’t miss John Grisham’s upcoming Framed, his first work of nonfiction since The Innocent Man! Mercer Mann, a popular writer from Camino Island, is back on the beach, marrying her boyfriend, Thomas, in a seaside ceremony. Bruce Cable, infamous owner of Bay Books, performs the wedding. Afterward, Bruce tells Mercer that he has stumbled upon an incredible story. Mercer desperately needs an idea for her next novel, and Bruce now has one.   The true story is about Dark Isle, a sliver of a barrier island not far off the North Florida coast. It was settled by freed slaves three hundred years ago, and their descendants lived there until 1955, when the last one was forced to leave. That last descendant is Lovely Jackson, elderly now, who loves her birthplace and its remarkable history. But now Tidal Breeze, a huge, ruthless corporate developer, wants to build a resort and casino on the island, which Lovely knows, deep down, is rightfully hers.   Mercer befriends Lovely, and they plunge into an enormous fight over who owns Dark Isle, taking on Tidal Breeze Corporation, its lawyers, lobbyists, and powerful Florida politicians. But Lovely knows something about the island that could seriously cloud the dollar signs in the developer’s eyes: the island is cursed. It has remained uninhabited for nearly a century for some very real and very troubling reasons. The deep secrets of the past are about to collide with the enormous ambitions of the present, and the fate of Dark Isle—and Camino Island, too—hangs in the balance.   Look for all of John Grisham’s rollicking Camino novels: Camino Island Camino Winds Camino Ghosts",

I loved this book.”—Gabrielle Zevin, author of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow<br/><br/>“I fell in love with the fascinating, brilliant family at the center of this riveting book.”—Ann Napolitano, author of Hello Beautiful<br/><br/>“We didn’t call the police right away.” Those are the electric first words of this extraordinary novel about a biracial Korean American family in Virginia whose lives are upended when their beloved father and husband goes missing.<br/><br/>Mia, the irreverent, hyperanalytical twenty-year-old daughter, has an explanation for everything—which is why she isn’t initially concerned when her father and younger brother Eugene don’t return from a walk in a nearby park. They must have lost their phone. Or stopped for an errand somewhere. But by the time Mia’s brother runs through the front door bloody and alone, it becomes clear that the father in this tight-knit family is missing and the only witness is Eugene, who has the rare genetic condition Angelman syndrome and cannot speak.<br/><br/>What follows is both a ticking-clock investigation into the whereabouts of a father and an emotionally rich portrait of a family whose most personal secrets just may be at the heart of his disappearance. Full of shocking twists and fascinating questions of love, language, and human connection, Happiness Falls is a mystery, a family drama, and a novel of profound philosophical inquiry. With all the powerful storytelling she brought to her award-winning debut, Miracle Creek, Angie Kim turns the missing-person story into something wholly original, creating an indelible tale of a family who must go to remarkable lengths to truly understand one another.",

    "synopsis": "A USA TODAY Bestseller “The Return of Ellie Black is a page-turning suspense novel, a shrewd character study, and a captivating mystery, all at the same time. The last fifty pages are magnetic. I couldn’t put it down until I’d experienced every last twist and turn.” —STEPHEN KING Detective Chelsey Calhoun’s life is turned upside down when she gets the call Ellie Black, a girl who disappeared years earlier, has resurfaced in the woods of Washington state—but Ellie’s reappearance leaves Chelsey with more questions than answers. It’s been twenty years since Detective Chelsey Calhoun’s sister vanished when they were teenagers, and ever since she’s been searching: for signs, for closure, for other missing girls. But happy endings are rare in Chelsey’s line of work. Then a glimmer: local teenager Ellie Black, who disappeared without a trace two years earlier, has been found alive in the woods of Washington State. But something is not right with Ellie. She won’t say where she’s been, or who she’s protecting, and it’s up to Chelsey to find the answers. She needs to get to the bottom of what happened to Ellie: for herself, and for the memory of her sister, but mostly for the next girl who could be taken—and who, unlike Ellie, might never return. The debut thriller from New York Times bestselling author Emiko Jean, The Return of Ellie Black is both a feminist tour de force about the embers of hope that burn in the aftermath of tragedy and a twisty page-turner that will shock and surprise you right up until the final page.",

    "synopsis": "OPRAH’S BOOK CLUB PICK * INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * “Stunning.” —People * “Dazzling yet devastating...Tóibín is simply one of the world’s best living literary writers.” —The Boston Globe * “Momentous and hugely affecting.” —The Wall Street Journal * From the beloved, critically acclaimed, bestselling author comes a spectacularly moving novel featuring Eilis Lacey, the complex and enigmatic heroine of Brooklyn, Tóibín’s most popular work in twenty years. Eilis Lacey is Irish, married to Tony Fiorello, a plumber and one of four Italian American brothers, all of whom live in neighboring houses on a cul-de-sac in Lindenhurst, Long Island, with their wives and children and Tony’s parents, a huge extended family. It is the spring of 1976 and Eilis is now forty with two teenage children. Though her ties to Ireland remain stronger than those that hold her to her new land and home, she has not returned in decades. One day, when Tony is at work an Irishman comes to the door asking for Eilis by name. He tells her that his wife is pregnant with Tony’s child and that when the baby is born, he will not raise it but instead deposit it on Eilis’s doorstep. It is what Eilis does—and what she refuses to do—in response to this stunning news that makes Tóibín’s novel so riveting and suspenseful. Long Island is a gorgeous story “about a woman thrashing against the constraints of fate” (Maureen Corrigan, Fresh Air). It is “a wonder, rich with yearning and regret” (Star Tribune, Minneapolis).",

    "synopsis": "An emotional, slow-burn, grumpy/sunshine, queer mid-century romance for fans of Evvie Drake Starts Over, about grief and found family, between the new star shortstop stuck in a batting slump and the reporter assigned to (reluctantly) cover his first season—set in the same universe as We Could Be So Good. The 1960 baseball season is shaping up to be the worst year of Eddie O’Leary’s life. He can’t manage to hit the ball, his new teammates hate him, he’s living out of a suitcase, and he’s homesick. When the team’s owner orders him to give a bunch of interviews to some snobby reporter, he’s ready to call it quits. He can barely manage to behave himself for the length of a game, let alone an entire season. But he’s already on thin ice, so he has no choice but to agree. Mark Bailey is not a sports reporter. He writes for the arts page, and these days he’s barely even managing to do that much. He’s had a rough year and just wants to be left alone in his too-empty apartment, mourning a partner he’d never been able to be public about. The last thing he needs is to spend a season writing about New York’s obnoxious new shortstop in a stunt to get the struggling newspaper more readers. Isolated together within the crush of an anonymous city, these two lonely souls orbit each other as they slowly give in to the inevitable gravity of their attraction. But Mark has vowed that he’ll never be someone’s secret ever again, and Eddie can’t be out as a professional athlete. It’s just them against the world, and they’ll both have to decide if that’s enough.",

    "synopsis": "\"Linwood Barclay's I Will Ruin You is a page-turner that also has important things to say. You'll get your money's worth out of this one.\" –Stephen King In the latest novel from New York Times bestselling author Linwood Barclay, a teacher’s act of heroism inadvertently makes him the target of a dangerous blackmailer who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. How would you react in a life-or-death situation? It’s a question everyone asks themselves, but few have to face in real life. English teacher Richard Boyle certainly never thought he would find himself talking down a former student intent on harming others, but when Mark LeDrew shows up at Richard’s school with a bomb strapped to his chest, Richard immediately jumps into action. Thanks to some quick thinking, he averts a major tragedy and is hailed as a hero, but not all the attention focused on him is positive. Richard’s brief moment in the spotlight puts him in the sights of a deranged blackmailer with a score to settle. The situation rapidly spirals out of control, drawing Richard into a fraught web of salacious accusations and deadly secrets. As he tries to uncover the truth he discovers that there’s something deeply wrong in the town—something that ties together Mark, the blackmailer, and a gang of ruthless drug dealers, and Richard has landed smack in the middle of it. He’s desperate to find a way out, but everyone in his life seems to be hiding something, and trusting the wrong person could cost him everything he loves. What price will he pay for one good deed?",

    "synopsis": "<p>La viva voce dell'intellettuale più lucida e appassionata del nostro tempo torna a visitarci per una formidabile resa dei conti sul potere, il femminismo, la fede, la letteratura. Ma soprattutto sulle dieci vite che ha vissuto con incantata sfacciataggine, senza paura, ripercorse oralmente nell'unica autobiografia organica possibile per una che ha attraversato il mondo correndo scalza, bruciando luminosamente ogni tappa. Alla vigilia di una morte che l'ha trovata gioiosa come una martire capace di cantare mentre avanza verso i leoni, Michela Murgia ha trascorso una settimana a raccontarsi a Beppe Cottafavi, suo editor e amico. Le registrazioni di quella sua ultima estate, ancora piena di storie come lo erano state le cinquanta precedenti, danno sostanza a questo suo libro straordinario, arricchito da quattro splendidi racconti ritrovati e da altri testi perduti che l'autrice ha scelto e indicato tra un ricordo e l'altro. Da un simile stagno brulicante di vita, come quello sulle cui rive è cresciuta, affiora un arcipelago di dettagli intimi: innamoramenti e parentele queer, matriarche oristanesi che sgranano rosari di cinque colori per salvare ogni continente, madonne con la parrucca, uomini violenti e maestri sognanti, lezioni di lingua sarda e cultura coreana, di esegesi biblica e di scrittura magica, di politica attiva e di militanza culturale. Franca e visionaria, antifascista e immune dai compromessi, Murgia ci rivela com'è che una ragazza di provincia, addestrata a leggere il Vangelo e ad accontentarsi di sopravvivere, si sia messa in testa di cambiare il mondo invece, affidandosi a un'irriducibile aspirazione alla felicità.<br></p>",

La voce di Redenta continuerà a risuonare a lungo, dopo che avrete chiuso l'ultima pagina.Intenso, coraggioso, I giorni di Vetro è il romanzo della nostra fragilità e della nostra ostinata speranza di fronte allo scandalo della Storia. Redenta è nata a Castrocaro il giorno del delitto Matteotti. In paese si mormora che abbia la scarogna e che non arriverà nemmeno alla festa di San Rocco. Invece per la festa lei è ancora viva, mentre Matteotti viene ritrovato morto. È cosí che comincia davvero il fascismo, e anche la vicenda di Redenta, della sua famiglia, della sua gente. Un mondo di radicale violenza - il Ventennio, la guerra, la prevaricazione maschile - eppure di inesauribile fiducia nell'umano. Sebbene Bruno, l'adorato amico d'infanzia che le aveva promesso di sposarla, incurante della sua «gamba matta» dovuta alla polio, scompaia senza motivo, lei non smette di aspettarlo. E quando il gerarca Vetro la sceglie come sposa, il sadismo che le infligge non riesce a spegnere in lei l'istinto di salvezza: degli altri, prima che di sé. La vita di Redenta incrocia quella di Iris, partigiana nella banda del leggendario comandante Diaz. Quale segreto nasconde Iris?- Ha qualcosa che non va, la purina, - dicevano.<br> - È la scarogna, - ripeteva tranquilla mia madre, premendomi sulla bocca il seno.<br> - Però ha una bella faccina, - aggiungevano, e quel «però» era il segno della loro compassione.<br> «Però è buona», «Però è tranquilla». Però non è come gli altri.<br> - Com'è che non piange? - chiedeva la sera mio padre.<br> - Piangerà. Le donne prima o poi piangono tutte. Hanno detto de Il valore affettivo: «L'autrice procede con voce sicura nel dipanare il filo dei ricordi, con autenticità, senso del ritmo e padronanza di tempi».<br> Viola Ardone «Nicoletta Verna ha scritto un romanzo familiare di rara intensità che affonda nell'enigma di un sentimento di colpa senza redenzione».<br> Corrado Augias «Una penna che controlla perfettamente trama e personaggi».<br> Valeria Parrella<br></p>",

Ich Bin Gefangen In Einer Welt Voller Monster, Die Als Männer Verkleidet Sind, Und Solchen, Die Nicht So Sind, Wie Sie Scheinen. Sie Werden Mich Nicht Ewig Festhalten. Ich Erkenne Die Person, Die Ich Geworden Bin, Nicht Wieder. Und Ich Kämpfe Darum, Meinen Weg Zurückzufinden. Zu Der Bestie, Die Mich Nachts Jagt. Sie Nennen Mich Einen Diamanten, Aber Sie Schufen Einen Engel Des Todes. Der Jäger Ich Wurde Als Raubtier Geboren, Die Rücksichtslosigkeit Tief In Meinen Knochen Verankert. Als Mir Nachts Das, Was Mir Gehört, Gestohlen Wurde Und Wie Ein Diamant In Einer Festung Versteckt Wird, Stellte Ich Fest, Dass Ich Die Bestie Nicht Länger Zurückhalten Kann. Blut Wird Den Boden Bedecken, Während Ich Die Welt Auseinanderreiße, Um Sie Zu Finden. Um Sie Dahin Zurückzubringen, Wo Sie Hingehört. Niemand Wird Meinem Zorn Entkommen, Vor Allem Nicht Diejenigen, Die Mich Verraten Haben.",
