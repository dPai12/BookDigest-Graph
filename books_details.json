    "synopsis": "From the New York Times bestselling author of the Expanse comes a spectacular new space opera that sees humanity fighting for its survival in a war as old as the universe itself. ★ “Masterful . . . . This is space opera at its best.” – Publishers Weekly (starred review) \"The start of something truly epic.\"  ― Fonda Lee, author of Jade City How humanity came to the planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end. The Carryx – part empire, part hive – have waged wars of conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy.  Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the humans of Anjiin.   Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his celebrated research team.  Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure.  Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game that they must play to survive: learning to understand – and manipulate – the Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination.  He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins. \"Corey is always one of the most engaging voices in the genre.\"  ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of Children of Time \"A bang up read. I want more.\"  ― Paolo Bacigalupi, author of The Water Knife \"A powerful, provocative masterpiece that I will be thinking about for a very long time.\"  ― Ryka Aoki, author of Light from Uncommon Stars",

    "synopsis": "In the vein of Where’d You Go, Bernadette and Fleishman Is in Trouble, a wickedly funny and incisive debut novel following a mother trapped in the rat race of NYC parenting as her life unravels. \"Funny, relatable fiction for anyone who thinks they're above the fray but still want to read all about it.\"—People \"Heavenly hilarity for readers.\"—Good Housekeeping It takes a village...just not this one.  Annie Lewin is at the end of her rope. She’s a mother of three young children, her workaholic husband is never around, and the vicious competition for spots in New York City’s kindergartens is heating up. A New York Times journalist-turned-parenting-advice-columnist for an internet start-up, Annie can’t help but judge the insanity of it all—even as she finds herself going to impossible lengths to secure the best spot for her own son. As Annie comes to terms with the infinitesimal odds of success, her intensifying rivalry with hotshot lawyer Belinda Brenner—a deliciously hateful nemesis, what with her perfectly curated bento box lunches and effortless Instagram chic—pushes her to the brink. Of course, this newly raw and unhinged version of Annie is great for the advice column: the more she spins out, the more clicks and comments she gets. But when she commits a ghastly social faux pas that goes viral, she’s forced to confront the question: is she really any better than the cutthroat parents she always judged? A shimmering epistolary novel incorporating emails, group texts, advice columns, newspaper profiles, and more, Plays Well with Others is a whip-smart, genuinely funny romp through the minefield of modern motherhood. But beneath its fast-paced, satirical veneer, Brickman gives us a fresh, open-hearted, all-too-real take on what it means to be a parent—fierce love, craziness, and all.  ",

    "synopsis": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER • An exhilarating novel about one American family and the dark moment that shatters their suburban paradise, from the New York Times bestselling author of Fleishman Is in Trouble New York Times Book Review Editors’ Choice • New York Magazine’s Beach Read Book Club Pick • Belletrist Book Club Pick “A big, juicy, wickedly funny social satire.”—Oprah Daily “Were we gangsters? No. But did we know how to start a fire?” In 1980, a wealthy businessman named Carl Fletcher is kidnapped from his driveway, brutalized, and held for ransom. He is returned to his wife and kids less than a week later, only slightly the worse, and the family moves on with their lives, resuming their prized places in the saga of the American dream, comforted in the realization that though their money may have been what endangered them, it is also what assured them their safety. But now, nearly forty years later, it’s clear that perhaps nobody ever got over anything, after all. Carl has spent the ensuing years secretly seeking closure to the matter of his kidnapping, while his wife, Ruth, has spent her potential protecting her husband’s emotional health. Their three grown children aren’t doing much better: Nathan’s chronic fear won’t allow him to advance at his law firm; Beamer, a Hollywood screenwriter, will consume anything—substance, foodstuff, women—in order to numb his own perpetual terror; and Jenny has spent her life so bent on proving that she’s not a product of her family’s pathology that she has come to define it. As they hover at the delicate precipice of a different kind of survival, they learn that the family fortune has dwindled to just about nothing, and they must face desperate questions about how much their wealth has played a part in both their lives’ successes and failures. Long Island Compromise spans the entirety of one family’s history, winding through decades and generations, all the way to the outrageous present, and confronting the mainstays of American Jewish life: tradition, the pursuit of success, the terror of history, fear of the future, old wives’ tales, evil eyes, ambition, achievement, boredom, dybbuks, inheritance, pyramid schemes, right-wing capitalists, beta-blockers, psychics, and the mostly unspoken love and shared experience that unite a family forever.",

    "synopsis": "“Sally Franson is a world class entertainer. She can finesse a serio-comic moment in a way that leaves you catching your breath. Deft and delicious, this book is a flat out delight machine. A heart opener, a page turner, and a true ‘originell!' I laughed out loud, I ugly cried, and I never, ever wanted it to end.\" -- Meg Ryan, actor, writer, director A charming, wise, and laugh-out-loud funny novel following an American woman competing on a Swedish reality show in an attempt to discover her roots. Paulie Johansson has never put much stock in the idea of family: she has her long-term boyfriend Declan and beloved best friend Jemma, and that’s more than enough for her. Yet one night on a lark, she lets Jemma convince her to audition for Sverige och Mig, a show on Swedish television where Swedish-Americans compete to win the ultimate prize: a reunion with their Swedish relatives. Much to her shock, her drunken submission video wins her a spot on the show, and against Declan’s advice Paulie decides to go for it. Armed with her Polaroid camera, a beat-up copy of Pippi Longstocking, and an unquenchable sense of possibility, Paulie hops on a plane to Sweden and launches into the contest with seven other Americans, all under the watchful eye of a camera crew. At first, Paulie is certain that she and her competitors have nothing in common besides their passports and views their bloodthirsty ambitions with suspicion. Yet amid the increasingly absurd challenges—rowing from Denmark to Sweden in the freezing rain, battling through obstacle courses, competing in a pickled herring eating contest—Paulie finds herself rethinking her snap judgments about her fellow countrymen, while her growing attachment to her Swedish roots increases her resolve to win the competition herself. Grappling with long-held notions of family, friendship, and love—not to mention her feelings for the distractingly handsome Swedish cameraman who’s been assigned to follow her around—Paulie starts to reconsider her past and rethink what she wants for the future. A fish-out-of-water tale filled with warmth, optimism, and wit, Big in Sweden is at its heart a love story: love for family, friends, country, and—most importantly—oneself.  \"If you devoured Pippi Longstocking as a kid, you will not be able to turn away from Big in Sweden. Reading this hilarious, heartfelt book was even more fun than watching reality television. I absolutely loved it!\" — Jessica Anya Blau, author of Mary Jane",

She wasn’t supposed to be picking up Starbucks for her smarmy boss. She wasn’t supposed to get hit by a car that jumped the curb. And she certainly wasn’t supposed to wake up in a hospital room next to Georgina Tate—the legendary matriarch of New York City businesswomen. Kelsey and Georgina couldn’t be more opposite. Kelsey’s a dreamer, a writer who questions her own skill. And Georgina is a confident businesswoman whose years of shouldering her way into boardrooms and making her voice heard have made her far too outspoken for the faint of heart. But now, when Georgina’s failing kidneys force her to face some big regrets about the way she’s lived her life, the two women recognize they share a common thread. Maybe it’s time to confront a few things. They must ask themselves: What if I said yes to everything I’ve always said no to? With Georgina as her companion, Kelsey soon finds herself doing things she’s never done before. Eating street food. Swimming in the ocean. Matchmaking for Georgina with the help of Georgina’s handsome son. And writing her own romance—both in book form and in real life. So begins the Summer of Yes.

Ritiene di essere affetta da Sindrome Premestruale Perenne di Tipo 1, patologia che la porta a disprezzare chiunque.Se infatti le donne di Tipo 3, per via degli estrogeni, sono ben disposte nei confronti del genere umano e degli uomini in particolare, e le donne di Tipo 2 tengono a bada il disordine ormonale con shopping compulsivo e pinte di prosecco, le donne di Tipo 1 – ceppo al quale appartiene Giovanna – non hanno sbalzi di umore, perché sono sempre di pessimo umore. La loro è, per l'appunto, una sindrome premestruale perenne.A intervalli regolari, Giovanna scrive lettere infuocate all'Inps perché questa \"malattia\" venga riconosciuta come invalidante: in tal modo lei potrebbe ricevere un assegno mensile, trascorrere il tempo leggendo i capolavori incompresi della letteratura americana e lasciare il suo posto di dottoranda mal pagata in un'università romana.Giovanna ha infatti due nemici giurati: il mondo intero e il professor Enrico Mazzetti.A 74 anni suonati, Mazzetti non vuole mollare la cattedra malgrado non sappia distinguere Bukowski da John Fante, per il quale lei nutre un amore incondizionato e a cui racconta dentro di sé i propri piani di distruzione e di rinascita. E mentre il direttore dell'Inps riesce pian piano a scorgere una certa validità nelle folli istanze di invalidità di Giovanna, lei trova un'inquietante alleata di Tipo 1 in grado forse di portare Mazzetti al pensionamento. Graffiante, ironico, caustico: un romanzo trascinante e divertentissimo che mette a nudo, spingendoli al paradosso, i mali del nostro tempo, dalla questione di genere al precariato, dai rapporti di coppia alla salute del pianeta. Al suo esordio Roberta Casasole ci regala l'epopea selvaggia di una donna scatenata che non ha paura di nessuno e fa a pezzi ogni tabù. \"E poi ci siamo noi, le donne di Tipo 1, con Sindrome Premestruale Perenne. L'amore ci sussurra all'orecchio dolci parole e noi gli gridiamo che non c'è campo. Donne che non hanno sbalzi di umore, perché sono sempre di pessimo umore. Noi siamo le elette.\"Un romanzo irriverente e scatenato, oltre ogni tabù.Si ride da pagina 1 a pagina 293.<br></p>",

Three generations of Schmidts have run their family’s beachfront restaurant and Jack has been at the helm since the death of his father. Jack puts the demands of the restaurant above all else, with a string of failed relationships, no hobbies, and no days off as proof of his commitment to the place. He can’t remember the last time he sat on the beach, or even enjoyed a moment to himself. Meanwhile, the DelDine group has been gradually snapping up beloved eateries along this stretch of coast and are pursuing Jack with a very generous offer to take Schmidt’s off his hands. Jack craves companionship and maybe even a family. He wonders if closing the door on the restaurant might open a new window for him. But who would he be without Schmidt’s, and can he trust DelDine’s claims that they will continue to employ his staff and honor his family’s legacy? When he receives startling news from the past, Jack begins to reshape his life and forge unexpected new friendships. But will he really let go of the very things that have defined him?",

    "synopsis": "From the nationally bestselling author of the “powerful, heartbreaking” (Shelf Awareness) The Stationery Shop, a heartfelt, epic new novel of friendship, betrayal, and redemption set against three transformative decades in Tehran, Iran. In 1950s Tehran, seven-year-old Ellie lives in grand comfort until the untimely death of her father, forcing Ellie and her mother to move to a tiny home downtown. Lonely and bearing the brunt of her mother’s endless grievances, Ellie dreams of a friend to alleviate her isolation. Luckily, on the first day of school, she meets Homa, a kind, passionate girl with a brave and irrepressible spirit. Together, the two girls play games, learn to cook in the stone kitchen of Homa’s warm home, wander through the colorful stalls of the Grand Bazaar, and share their ambitions for becoming “lion women.” But their happiness is disrupted when Ellie and her mother are afforded the opportunity to return to their previous bourgeois life. Now a popular student at the best girls’ high school in Iran, Ellie’s memories of Homa begin to fade. Years later, however, her sudden reappearance in Ellie’s privileged world alters the course of both of their lives. Together, the two young women come of age and pursue their own goals for meaningful futures. But as the political turmoil in Iran builds to a breaking point, one earth-shattering betrayal will have enormous consequences. Written with Marjan Kamali’s signature “evocative, devastating, and hauntingly beautiful” (Whitney Scharer, author of The Age of Light) prose, The Lion Women of Tehran is a sweeping exploration of how profoundly we are shaped by those we meet when we are young, and the way love and courage transforms our lives.",

    "synopsis": "<p>- Scoprire la profondità della tristezza di un figlio, a neanche sedici anni, è come trovare qualcosa in un posto in cui non te lo saresti mai aspettato. In cui proprio non dovrebbe esserci.<br> - Che vuoi dire?<br> - Tipo, non so. Come trovare la neve in fondo al mare.Matteo Bussola racconta un nodo del nostro tempo: la fragilità adolescenziale. Scrive una storia toccante, piena di grazia, sul tradimento che implica diventare sé stessi. E ci mostra, con onestà e delicatezza, quel che si prova davanti al dolore di un figlio, ma anche la luce dell'essere genitori, che pure nel buio continua a brillare. Perché è difficile accogliere la verità di chi amiamo, soprattutto se lo abbiamo messo al mondo. Ma l'amore porta sempre con sé una rinascita. Un padre e un figlio, dentro una stanza. L'uno di fronte all'altro, come mai sono stati. Ciascuno lo specchio dell'altro. Loro due, insieme, in un reparto di neuropsichiatria infantile. Ci sono altri genitori, in quel reparto, altri figli. Adolescenti che rifiutano il cibo o che si fanno del male, che vivono l'estenuante fatica di crescere, dentro famiglie incapaci di dare un nome al loro tormento. E madri e padri spaesati, che condividono la stessa ferita, l'intollerabile sensazione di non essere piú all'altezza del proprio compito. Con la voce calda, intima, di un padre smarrito, Matteo Bussola fotografa l'istante spaventoso in cui genitori e figli smettono di riconoscersi, e parlarsi diventa impossibile. Attraverso un pugno di personaggi strazianti e bellissimi, ci ricorda che ogni essere umano è un mistero, anche quando siamo noi ad averlo generato.<br></p>",

    "synopsis": "<p>Salento, 1959. Lorenzo e Agnese hanno perso tutto. E lo capiscono quando, con gli occhi tristi che si porta dietro da una vita, il padre annuncia di aver venduto il saponificio di famiglia, un'eredità che lui ha vissuto come una condanna. Per Lorenzo e Agnese, invece, quella fabbrica che il nonno ha creato dal nulla, che profuma di talco, di essenze floreali e di oli vegetali, e che occupa ogni loro pensiero, era la certezza di un presente sereno e la promessa di un futuro da tracciare insieme, uniti. Quindi l'idea di rimanere lì come semplici operai sotto un nuovo, arrogante padrone è devastante per entrambi. Lorenzo, orgoglioso e impulsivo, se ne va sbattendo la porta, col cuore colmo di rabbia e con un solo obiettivo: trovare i soldi necessari per riprendersi quello che è suo. Ma Agnese non lo segue: tanto risoluta se si tratta di formulare saponi quanto insicura quando le tocca abitare il mondo al di fuori del saponificio, dichiara: «Io resto dov'è casa mia». È una crepa profonda, apparentemente insanabile, quella che si apre tra fratello e sorella e li spingerà su strade opposte e imprevedibili. Perché vogliono la stessa cosa, Lorenzo e Agnese, almeno finché l'amore non li porterà di nuovo a un bivio. Ognuno dei due farà una scelta, tracciando un altro domani… Sarà per entrambi un domani senza rimpianti? Questa è la storia della passione che prima unisce e poi divide un fratello e una sorella. Una storia che parla di decisioni prese ascoltando la mente o il cuore oppure tutti e due. Di quell'istante che può cambiare una vita intera. Ma anche di un'Italia che, incredula, sta scoprendo un improvviso benessere, che lavora alla catena di montaggio e poi canta con Mina e balla al ritmo del twist, giovane, creativa, impaziente…<br></p>",

He’s never taken other people half as seriously as they take themselves, which is the first of his mistakes. The second is a new project: opportunistic and precisely calibrated to rake in a fortune. Riding on the high of a best-selling biography of Vermeer and fielding more inquiries and requests than he has the time or patience to pursue, Campbell has nevertheless still not managed to shake the question of money. The fact of his quiet loan from a school friend now embroiled in scandal makes the ever-present worry feel even more pressing. His unflappable agent, Atticus; his steadfast wife, Elizabeth; his sister, Moira, crusading parliamentarian for the poor; his well-adjusted, well-off adult children, Angus and Kenzie; and all the outward trappings of success can’t conceal that something in his life is off. As Campbell becomes increasingly entangled with a brilliant student, convention-smashing and working class, like he used to be, he feels he’s been given a second chance to embrace the change that frightens him, even as he sees trouble brewing for his family and friends. Campbell’s personal quest takes him down darker roads than he could have imagined, and all his worlds—the art scene and academia, fashion and the English aristocracy, journalism and the internet—collide in spectacular fashion, culminating in one shocking night on Caledonian Road.</p>",

I loved this book.”—Gabrielle Zevin, author of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow<br/><br/>“I fell in love with the fascinating, brilliant family at the center of this riveting book.”—Ann Napolitano, author of Hello Beautiful<br/><br/>“We didn’t call the police right away.” Those are the electric first words of this extraordinary novel about a biracial Korean American family in Virginia whose lives are upended when their beloved father and husband goes missing.<br/><br/>Mia, the irreverent, hyperanalytical twenty-year-old daughter, has an explanation for everything—which is why she isn’t initially concerned when her father and younger brother Eugene don’t return from a walk in a nearby park. They must have lost their phone. Or stopped for an errand somewhere. But by the time Mia’s brother runs through the front door bloody and alone, it becomes clear that the father in this tight-knit family is missing and the only witness is Eugene, who has the rare genetic condition Angelman syndrome and cannot speak.<br/><br/>What follows is both a ticking-clock investigation into the whereabouts of a father and an emotionally rich portrait of a family whose most personal secrets just may be at the heart of his disappearance. Full of shocking twists and fascinating questions of love, language, and human connection, Happiness Falls is a mystery, a family drama, and a novel of profound philosophical inquiry. With all the powerful storytelling she brought to her award-winning debut, Miracle Creek, Angie Kim turns the missing-person story into something wholly original, creating an indelible tale of a family who must go to remarkable lengths to truly understand one another.",

    "synopsis": "A USA TODAY Bestseller “The Return of Ellie Black is a page-turning suspense novel, a shrewd character study, and a captivating mystery, all at the same time. The last fifty pages are magnetic. I couldn’t put it down until I’d experienced every last twist and turn.” —STEPHEN KING Detective Chelsey Calhoun’s life is turned upside down when she gets the call Ellie Black, a girl who disappeared years earlier, has resurfaced in the woods of Washington state—but Ellie’s reappearance leaves Chelsey with more questions than answers. It’s been twenty years since Detective Chelsey Calhoun’s sister vanished when they were teenagers, and ever since she’s been searching: for signs, for closure, for other missing girls. But happy endings are rare in Chelsey’s line of work. Then a glimmer: local teenager Ellie Black, who disappeared without a trace two years earlier, has been found alive in the woods of Washington State. But something is not right with Ellie. She won’t say where she’s been, or who she’s protecting, and it’s up to Chelsey to find the answers. She needs to get to the bottom of what happened to Ellie: for herself, and for the memory of her sister, but mostly for the next girl who could be taken—and who, unlike Ellie, might never return. The debut thriller from New York Times bestselling author Emiko Jean, The Return of Ellie Black is both a feminist tour de force about the embers of hope that burn in the aftermath of tragedy and a twisty page-turner that will shock and surprise you right up until the final page.",

    "synopsis": "OPRAH’S BOOK CLUB PICK * INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * “Stunning.” —People * “Dazzling yet devastating...Tóibín is simply one of the world’s best living literary writers.” —The Boston Globe * “Momentous and hugely affecting.” —The Wall Street Journal * From the beloved, critically acclaimed, bestselling author comes a spectacularly moving novel featuring Eilis Lacey, the complex and enigmatic heroine of Brooklyn, Tóibín’s most popular work in twenty years. Eilis Lacey is Irish, married to Tony Fiorello, a plumber and one of four Italian American brothers, all of whom live in neighboring houses on a cul-de-sac in Lindenhurst, Long Island, with their wives and children and Tony’s parents, a huge extended family. It is the spring of 1976 and Eilis is now forty with two teenage children. Though her ties to Ireland remain stronger than those that hold her to her new land and home, she has not returned in decades. One day, when Tony is at work an Irishman comes to the door asking for Eilis by name. He tells her that his wife is pregnant with Tony’s child and that when the baby is born, he will not raise it but instead deposit it on Eilis’s doorstep. It is what Eilis does—and what she refuses to do—in response to this stunning news that makes Tóibín’s novel so riveting and suspenseful. Long Island is a gorgeous story “about a woman thrashing against the constraints of fate” (Maureen Corrigan, Fresh Air). It is “a wonder, rich with yearning and regret” (Star Tribune, Minneapolis).",

    "synopsis": "\"Linwood Barclay's I Will Ruin You is a page-turner that also has important things to say. You'll get your money's worth out of this one.\" –Stephen King In the latest novel from New York Times bestselling author Linwood Barclay, a teacher’s act of heroism inadvertently makes him the target of a dangerous blackmailer who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. How would you react in a life-or-death situation? It’s a question everyone asks themselves, but few have to face in real life. English teacher Richard Boyle certainly never thought he would find himself talking down a former student intent on harming others, but when Mark LeDrew shows up at Richard’s school with a bomb strapped to his chest, Richard immediately jumps into action. Thanks to some quick thinking, he averts a major tragedy and is hailed as a hero, but not all the attention focused on him is positive. Richard’s brief moment in the spotlight puts him in the sights of a deranged blackmailer with a score to settle. The situation rapidly spirals out of control, drawing Richard into a fraught web of salacious accusations and deadly secrets. As he tries to uncover the truth he discovers that there’s something deeply wrong in the town—something that ties together Mark, the blackmailer, and a gang of ruthless drug dealers, and Richard has landed smack in the middle of it. He’s desperate to find a way out, but everyone in his life seems to be hiding something, and trusting the wrong person could cost him everything he loves. What price will he pay for one good deed?",

    "synopsis": "<p>La viva voce dell'intellettuale più lucida e appassionata del nostro tempo torna a visitarci per una formidabile resa dei conti sul potere, il femminismo, la fede, la letteratura. Ma soprattutto sulle dieci vite che ha vissuto con incantata sfacciataggine, senza paura, ripercorse oralmente nell'unica autobiografia organica possibile per una che ha attraversato il mondo correndo scalza, bruciando luminosamente ogni tappa. Alla vigilia di una morte che l'ha trovata gioiosa come una martire capace di cantare mentre avanza verso i leoni, Michela Murgia ha trascorso una settimana a raccontarsi a Beppe Cottafavi, suo editor e amico. Le registrazioni di quella sua ultima estate, ancora piena di storie come lo erano state le cinquanta precedenti, danno sostanza a questo suo libro straordinario, arricchito da quattro splendidi racconti ritrovati e da altri testi perduti che l'autrice ha scelto e indicato tra un ricordo e l'altro. Da un simile stagno brulicante di vita, come quello sulle cui rive è cresciuta, affiora un arcipelago di dettagli intimi: innamoramenti e parentele queer, matriarche oristanesi che sgranano rosari di cinque colori per salvare ogni continente, madonne con la parrucca, uomini violenti e maestri sognanti, lezioni di lingua sarda e cultura coreana, di esegesi biblica e di scrittura magica, di politica attiva e di militanza culturale. Franca e visionaria, antifascista e immune dai compromessi, Murgia ci rivela com'è che una ragazza di provincia, addestrata a leggere il Vangelo e ad accontentarsi di sopravvivere, si sia messa in testa di cambiare il mondo invece, affidandosi a un'irriducibile aspirazione alla felicità.<br></p>",
